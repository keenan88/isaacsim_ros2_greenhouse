[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbackward_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "backward_ros", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "backward_ros" with
  any of the following names:

    backward_rosConfig.cmake
    backward_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "backward_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "backward_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "backward_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
